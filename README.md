# On-Off-LED-Pattern
# LED Sequence Control with Push Button

This is an Arduino project that cycles through a sequence of 8 LEDs, allowing the user to pause and resume the sequence using a push button.

## üîß Overview

- The project lights up 8 LEDs in sequence with a small delay between each.
- A **push button** toggles between two states:
  - **Running**: LEDs continue to light in sequence.
  - **Paused**: The current LED turns off and the sequence halts until the button is pressed again.

## üéÆ How It Works

- The system starts in the **running** state (`state = 1`).
- Each press of the button toggles between `state = 1` (run) and `state = 0` (pause).
- While in `state = 0`, the LEDs stop, and the system waits for another button press to resume.
